## Introduction

This project is part of [FIWARE](http://fiware.org). You will find more information about this FIWARE GE [here](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/pep-proxy-wilma).

- You will find the source code of this project in GitHub [here](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/business-ecosystem-logic-proxy)
- You will find the documentation of this project in Read the Docs [here](http://fiware-pep-proxy.readthedocs.org/)

This component handles the request to the TMForum APIs and applies a business logic layer so only certain users are allowed to perform certain operations. Additionally, this component offers a graphical user interface that can be used by end-users to access this set of APIs in a simpler way (without having REST knowledge).

## API Overview

Requests to proxy should be made with a special HTTP Header: Authorization.
This header contains the OAuth access token obtained from FIWARE IDM GE.

Example of request:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: proxy_host
Authorization: Bearer z2zXk...ANOXvZrmvxvSg
```

To test the proxy you can generate this request running the following command:

```
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer z2zXk...ANOXvZrmvxvSg" http://proxy_host
```

Once authenticated, the forwarded request will include additional HTTP headers with user info:

```
X-Nick-Name: nickname of the user in IdM
X-Display-Name: display name of user in IdM
X-Roles: roles of the user in IdM
X-Organizations: organizations in IdM
```
