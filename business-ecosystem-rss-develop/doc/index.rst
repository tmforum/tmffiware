Overview

RSS-RI is the reference implementation of the Revenue Settlement and Sharing System GE. RSS-RI is in charge of distributing the revenues originated by the usage of a given service among the involved stakeholders. In particular, it focuses on distributing part of the revenue generated by a service between the Store Provider and the Service Provider(s) responsible for the service. With the term "service" we refer to both final applications and backend application services (typically exposed through an API). Note that, in the case of composite services, more than one service provider may have to receive a share of the revenues.

This project is part of `FIWARE <http://www.fiware.org>`__.
